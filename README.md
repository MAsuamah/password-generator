# Secure Password Generator
This secure password generator has the ability to provide strong passwords that meet the criteria selected by the user. 
The password generator will provide a string of random characters with the purpose of protecting sensitive data and providing greater security.

## How to Use
* To generate your password, click the generate password button.
* You will be given a series of prompts at the top of the page. 
* First you will enter the amount of characters you want in your password. Your password must be between 8 and 128 characters.
* You will be asked which character types you would like to include in your password. You have the choices of lowercase, uppercase, special characters, 
and numbers. You must choose at least one character type to generate your password. 
* When all prompts are answered, a password will be displayed in the text box on the page, and the characters will match the criteria selected by the user.
